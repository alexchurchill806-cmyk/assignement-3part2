# Subtraction of Integers

Subtraction of integers means finding the difference between two whole numbers.
It can also be thought of as adding the opposite of a number.

## Rule
Subtracting a number is the same as adding its opposite.

## Example
5 − 8 = 5 + (−8)

Since −8 is larger in absolute value than 5, the result is negative.

Final Answer:
5 − 8 = −3
